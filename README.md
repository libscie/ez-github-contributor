# mizzimig

Markdown you see is markdown you get (MYSIMYG â‰ˆ mizzimig): A GitHub app for contributions without any knowledge of GitHub.

We are currently in active development. This involves building out the React website with a Lexical editor, and a GitHub app that can be installed on relevant repositories - where the markdown content will be used to create a Pull Request with the relevant content in a file or directly as an issue. This GitHub app aims to make it easier for people to contribute to open source documentation, without having the need to understand either Markdown or GitHub.

We asked ChatGPT what it associates with "Mizzimig" and it spit out an image of an owl. :owl: We'll take it!
