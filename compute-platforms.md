Something we (ITvO) have been thinking about writing:
An overview of the different compute platforms with some indication which is most useful for a specific research need. HPC (@ SURF & VU), Jupyter Notebooks, Research Cloud, SciCloud, Azure Virtual Desktop, OpenShift, etc.
This would be a living document, which I think fits the idea of the handbook well.
